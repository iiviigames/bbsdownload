The Pico-8 BBS Download Link-inator!
=====================================

This is a JS Userscript that adds a nice, big download link right under the cart player on the Pico-8 Bulletin Board System. Does literally what it says on the tin.

To use this, you need something like [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed in your browser. (I'm using Firefox Developer ATM.)

Notes
------

Is this necessary? Nope, but I got sick of clicking the link, then right click save as...you know the deal. This just makes a big fat link on the page, in a bright blue color, right beneath the player for the game itself.

If you want to fix the code up, please do! It's ugly, and I tried to rig it so it doesn't throw a console error, but couldn't spend any more than the 2 hours I did on it. 

**ENJOY!**
