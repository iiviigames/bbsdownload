## A Little Less Tedious

This is a userscript written in `.js`, that adds a nice, big download link right under the cart player on the [Lexaloffle Bulletin Board System](https://lexaloffle.com/bbs), where many carts and pods await you. 

Rather than the constant saving of images, I've automated the process entirely, keeping up with zeps changes as he's made them.

- **V0.6** - _Added Picotron support_

To use this, you need something like [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed in your browser. (I'm using Firefox Developer ATM, but this is by far the best option on every browser. Whatever flavor of Chrome, FireFox, Opera, or AOL (okay, maybe I lied about AOL), it will work just fine. Just head over to your browsers addon store, and install from there.)

- This is not possible on mobile, before anyone opens an issue. 😘

Notes
------

Is this necessary? Nope, but I got sick of clicking the link, then right click save as...you know the deal. This just makes a big fat link on the page, in a bright blue color, right beneath the player for the game itself.

If you want to fix the code up, please do! It's ugly, and I tried to rig it so it doesn't throw a console error, but couldn't spend any more than the 2 hours I did on it. 

**ENJOY!**
